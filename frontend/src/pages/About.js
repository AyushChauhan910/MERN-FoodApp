      <p>
        Hi, I’m Ayush, the creator of this Food Delivery MERN App—a project I built from scratch to combine my passion for web development and my 
        love for practical, real-world solutions. I designed and developed this application as a personal project to deepen my skills in 
        JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, and to experience the full process of taking an idea from concept to a working product.
